# NFB_Analysis-Design-Tool
#PART1: Full negative feedback system analysis, calculate all frequency response parameter, study stability of system, draw locus diagram with tunable K , 
transient analysis of the system with transient C/Cs 
#PART2: Design negative feedback system by calculate frequency response of feedback factor(beta) to achieve required system response with required C/Cs given than open loop responce or vice versa
#PART3: Design circuit corresponding to output of PART2.

SOON, PART1.....
